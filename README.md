library(YlGrBlPal)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)
library(colorspace)
```

### Example for YlGrBl\_pal()

``` r
library('ggplot2')
 ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
 geom_point(color = YlGrBl_pal()(1))+
   theme_bw()+
   labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
        y = "Body Mass (gram)",
        title = "Relationship between body mass and flipper length of the penguins")
#> Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

Example for discrete-scale

``` r
ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) +
geom_point(aes(color = species))+
scale_colour_YlGrBl_d()+
  theme_bw()+
  labs(x = "Flipper length (mm)",
        y = "Body Mass (gram)",
        title = "Relationship between body mass and flipper length of the penguins by species")
#> Warning: Removed 2 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
